        Moves the robot. A drunkbot selects a random direction and tries to move to the adjacent square in that
        direction. If there is a wall or another robot in that square, the robot will collide (and does not move). If
        the drunkbot collides with something, it remains facing whatever it collided with and ends its turn there. If
        the drunkbot did not collide with anything, it turns in a new direction after moving. The new facing is again
        selected again at random. Note: this means that assuming that the drunkbot did not collide, it picks two random
        directions per turn, one to move in and one to face in.

        The drunkbot selects a random direction using the following algorithm:

        - Get all the direction constants in a list, in the order defined by the direction module.

        - Select a random list item (for example, using random.choice(sequence)).

        - Use the direction found.

        This method assumes that it is called only if the robot is not broken or stuck.
