class Robot():
    """
    The class Robot represents robots (or "bots") which inhabit two
    dimensional grid worlds. More specifically, each instance of the class represents
    a "robot body" (or "chassis" or "hardware") and basic functionality of such a robot.
    Each "robot body" is associated with a "robot brain" that controls the body
    and determines what functionality is activated and when.

    A robot is equipped with the various capabilities:

     - It can sense its own surroundings (location, facing, the world that it is in).

     - It can move forward.

     - It can spin around in any one of the four main compass directions.

     - It can sense whether it is broken or not, and whether it is "stuck" in a square
        between four walls.

    When a robot's take_turn() method is called, it uses its "brain" to figure
    out what to do (move, turn about, etc.). Robots with different kinds of brains behave
    differently.

    See the documentation of RobotWorld and RobotBrain.

         1. The robot checks its sensors to see if it is stuck or broken. (If it is, it doesn't do anything.)
         2. If not, it call's it's brain's move_body() method, leaving it up to the brain to decide
            what happens next.
         3. The move_body() method will then determine how the robot behaves, usually calling
            various methods of the robot's body (i.e., the Robot object whose turn it is),
            e.g. move, spin. However, it is not up to the Robot object
            to decide which of its methods get called - that depends on the implementation of the robot's brain.
