        Moves the given "body", i.e., the robot given as a parameter. A lovebot tries to home in on its beloved unless
        it already is in an adjacent square (diagonally adjacent is not good enough). The lovebot does not know how to
        avoid obstacles, and blindly follows its primitive urges. If there is a wall or another bot in the chosen
        direction, the lovebot will collide into it (causing it to break instead of moving into the square).

        The path of movement is chosen as follows. First the lovebot calculates its distance to its target in both x and
        y dimension. It moves one square at a time so that either x or y distance decreases by one, depending on which
        one is greater. The greater of the two is decremented. In the case that the distances are equal, x is
        decremented. The lovebot only moves one square per turn. When moving (or colliding) a lovebot turns to face the
        direction it is moving in.

        This method assumes that it is called only if the robot is not broken or stuck.
